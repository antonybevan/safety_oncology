# SAP Summary: PBCAR20A-01

**Extracted Essential Information for Clinical Programming**

## Study Title
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for “A Phase 1/2a, Open-label, Dose-escalation, Dose-expansion, Parallel Assignment Study to Evaluate the Safety and Clinical Activity of PBCAR20A in Study Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (r/r) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or r/r Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)”

## Analysis Populations
### Safety Population
- Subjects will only appear once in the Safety population, even if they are retreated with PBCAR20A.
- Subjects who are retreated will be included in the Response Evaluable population for each treatment of PBCAR20A 

 Enrolled (ITT) and Safety population consists of the same subjects for this study.
