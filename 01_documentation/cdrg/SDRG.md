# Study Data Reviewer Guide (SDRG)
**Study**: BV-CAR20-P1  
**Date**: 2026-02-08

## 1. Introduction
This Study Data Reviewer's Guide (SDRG) documents the SDTM tabulation datasets generated for Study BV-CAR20-P1. The repository includes Phase 1 SDTM and a Phase 2a synthetic expansion used for portfolio demonstrations.

## 2. Data Sources and Generation
- SDTM domains are derived from synthetic raw CSV extracts in `02_datasets` via programs in `03_programs/tabulations`.
- Phase 2a expansion domains are generated by `03_programs/data_gen/generate_phase2a_full.sas`.

## 3. Domain-Specific Notes

### 3.1 DM (Demographics)
- Derived from `raw_dm.csv`.
- `RFSTDTC` sourced from the raw file; `RFXSTDTC` uses lymphodepletion start (`LDSTDT`) when available.
- `ARMCD`/`ARM` assigned by dose level.

### 3.2 EX (Exposure)
- Derived from `raw_ex.csv`.
- `EXADJ` and dose details are preserved from source.
- `EXSEQ` assigned after sorting by subject, date, and treatment.

### 3.3 AE (Adverse Events)
- Derived from `raw_ae.csv`.
- `AETOXGR` normalized from source grade text; `AESEV` derived from `AETOXGR`.
- `AEOUT`, `AECONTRT`, and `AEACN` are included; `AEACN` is derived for action-taken traceability.

### 3.4 RS (Response)
- Derived from `raw_rs.csv` where available and from Phase 2a synthetic response generation.
- `RSCAT` and `RSSTRESC` are preserved for response criteria and standardized response values.

### 3.5 LB (Laboratory)
- Derived from `raw_lb.csv`.
- Reference ranges (`LBORNRLO`, `LBORNRHI`) are used for normal range indicators in ADaM.
- Standardized result variables `LBSTRESC` and `LBSTRESN` are derived from `LBORRES`.

### 3.6 SUPP Domains
- `SUPPAE` is used for ASTCT consensus grade (`ASTCTGR`) when present.

### 3.7 Trial Design (TA, TE, TS)
- Trial design domains are generated by `gen_trial_design.sas` and reflect the protocol dose-escalation structure.

## 4. Phase 2a Expansion (Synthetic)
The Phase 2a expansion creates synthetic SDTM datasets for expansion arms:
- `sdtm.dm_phase2a_full`, `sdtm.ex_phase2a_full`, `sdtm.ae_phase2a_full`, `sdtm.rs_phase2a_full`
- Exploratory biomarker datasets: `sdtm.cart_kinetics`, `sdtm.cytokines`, `sdtm.mrd_phase2a_full`
These datasets are not part of the SAP submission scope.

## 5. Conformance and Validation
- Target standard: SDTMIG v3.4.
- No external validation (Pinnacle 21) is executed in this repository.
- A Define-XML shell exists at `02_datasets/define/define.xml`, but it is not yet complete for submission.
- Submission readiness requires formal validation, finalized Define-XML metadata, and domain-level QC.
